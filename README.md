Fae is CMS for Rails unlike any other. Like most Rails CMS engines, Fae provides all the basics to get you up and running: authentication, a responsive UI, form element and workflows. But unlike other CMS engines, Fae's methodology is based around generators and a DSL over configuration. This allows you to get to a working CMS very quickly, but gives you the flexibility to customize any piece you need.

## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`

```ruby
gem 'fae-rails'
```
Run the installer

```bash
$ rails g fae:install
```

After the installer completes, visit `/admin` and setup your first user account. That should automatically log you in to your blank Fae instance.

### Dependencies

#### Rails

Fae supports Rails >= 4.1.

#### Sass and sass-rails

Fae requires `sass >= 3.4` and `sass-rails >= 5`.

If you're using Rails 4.1 you'll need to update the versions in the `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'sass-rails', '~> 5.0.0'
gem 'sass', '~> 3.4.0'
```

and run:

```bash
$ bundle update sass-rails
$ bundle update sass
```
