Publish Story:
User lands on nelify page
  show publish buttons for hooks in db.
  show list of past deploys including time spent etc.
    filter for env?

User clicks a publish button
  all publish buttons are now disabled
  hit deploys api and get the most recent ID
  use that to poll it's detail endpoint for completion status
  when status is complete ("ready")
    enable buttons
    refresh past deploys list

I’d add under “User lands on netlify page” above past deploys:
show a list a Fae Changes since last deploy - this will likely have to be separated by ENV, but also means we’ll have to track deploys by env to compare timestamps
then under “User clicks a publish button” I’d add:
some way to show the progress of the build, maybe show time elapsed against the average of the last three builds
 and finally:
some way for users to sign up to get emailed deploy notifications (maybe not necessary in POC if we improve build progress interface)

- add fae_publish_hooks scaffold similar to other fae things
- add service class? or?
- add publish page
- set up JS
